      <description>Christine Bandela cmb5726 0. Introduction (4 pts) For this exploratory data analysis project I have chosen two datasets that I will use to compare and contrast betweeen Game of Thrones characters and thier infuence on baby names from 1880 to 2015. The dataset ‘GOT’contains variables about the Game of Thrones characters including their first name, male, as well as, popularity. The ’Names’ dataset contains variables including YearofBirth, Number, name and Sex.</description>

      <description>Christine Bandela cmb5726  Modeling Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (as a PDF) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 11/24/2019. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). Knit an html copy too, for later! In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>
